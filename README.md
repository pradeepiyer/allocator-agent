# Allocator Agent

AI-powered capital allocation agent for identifying high-quality investment opportunities and analyzing stocks using fundamental investing principles.

## Overview

Allocator Agent is built on [agent-kit](https://github.com/pradeepiyer/agent-kit) and uses OpenAI's Responses API to provide sophisticated stock analysis grounded in proven investment principles:

- **Owner-operator mindset**: Focus on management quality and skin in the game
- **Capital allocation excellence**: Track record of smart buybacks, M&A, and capital deployment
- **Financial quality**: High ROIC, ROE, margins, and strong balance sheets
- **Competitive moats**: Sustainable competitive advantages
- **Reasonable valuations**: Price discipline and margin of safety
- **Technical analysis**: Entry/exit timing and momentum

## Features

### üéØ Two Core Capabilities

1. **Comprehensive Stock Analysis** (`/analyze`)
   - Deep dive on any stock covering all investment principles
   - Management quality and insider ownership analysis
   - Capital allocation track record
   - Financial metrics and trends
   - Competitive position assessment
   - Valuation analysis
   - Technical indicators
   - Clear investment recommendation

2. **Similar Stock Finder** (`/similar`)
   - Find stocks with similar characteristics
   - Programmatic discovery using sector/industry classification
   - Multi-dimensional comparison (business model, financials, management, etc.)
   - Ranked results with similarity scores (sector, industry, market cap, margins, growth, ROE)
   - Identifies both obvious and non-obvious comparables
   - Filters candidates by market cap range (0.3x-3x) for relevance

### üõ†Ô∏è Data Sources

Currently powered by **yfinance** (free, no API key required):
- Financial statements and metrics
- Insider ownership and transactions
- Institutional holdings

### Tools Available

The agent has access to these financial data tools:

- `get_stock_fundamentals()` - Financial metrics, ROIC, ROE, margins
- `get_insider_ownership()` - Insider holdings and transactions
- `get_institutional_holders()` - Major shareholders
- `get_share_data()` - Share count history and buybacks
- `get_management_compensation()` - Executive pay structure
- `get_technical_indicators()` - Price trends, RSI, MACD, moving averages
- `get_valuation_metrics()` - P/E, P/B, P/S, EV/EBITDA, PEG
- `get_financial_history()` - Multi-year trends
- `calculate_similarity()` - Stock comparison
- `find_similar_companies()` - Programmatic discovery of similar stocks by sector/industry

Plus built-in `web_search` for news, filings, and qualitative research.

## Configuration

### Agent Configuration

Edit `allocator/config.yaml` or create `~/.agent-kit/allocator.yaml`:

```yaml
max_iterations: 25  # Allows for complex multi-step analysis
```

### Global agent-kit Configuration

Configure OpenAI model and settings in `~/.agent-kit/config.yaml`:

```yaml
openai:
  api_key: "${OPENAI_API_KEY}"
  model: "gpt-4o"
  pool_size: 8

agents:
  max_iterations: 20
  max_parallel_tools: 5
```

## Development

### Project Structure

The agent follows agent-kit's extension pattern:

1. **Tools** (`tools.py`): Python functions that fetch/analyze data
2. **Prompts** (`prompts/*.yaml`): YAML files encoding investment principles
3. **Agent** (`agent.py`): Methods that orchestrate tool calls using prompts
4. **Console** (`console.py`): User interface with slash commands

### Adding New Tools

1. Define the async function in `tools.py`
2. Add tool definition to `get_tool_definitions()`
3. Register in `execute_tool()` dispatcher
4. The LLM can now use it automatically

### Extending with More Data Sources

To add Financial Modeling Prep or other APIs:

1. Install additional package (e.g., `uv add financialmodelingprep`)
2. Add API functions to `tools.py`
3. Add corresponding tool definitions
4. Update prompts if needed

No changes to agent logic required - tools are automatically available to LLM.

## Examples

### Example: Comprehensive Analysis
```
/analyze BRK.B

Result: Deep analysis of Berkshire Hathaway covering:
- Buffett/Munger's capital allocation track record
- Insurance float as competitive advantage
- Ownership of wholly-owned subsidiaries
- Valuation vs book value
- Recent portfolio changes
- Investment recommendation
```

### Example: Find Similar Stocks
```
/similar COST

Result: Stocks similar to Costco:
1. WMT (Walmart) - Similar retail, different model
2. TGT (Target) - Comparable margins, different positioning
3. AMZN (Amazon) - E-commerce overlap
Each with similarity scores and comparison
```

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific**: "Analyze AAPL's capital allocation over the last 5 years" is better than just "AAPL"
2. **Use follow-ups**: The agent maintains conversation context - ask follow-up questions
3. **Combine analysis**: "Compare GOOGL and META, then find 3 similar stocks"
4. **Provide context**: "Looking for value stocks in technology" helps screening
5. **Check sources**: Agent cites sources - verify important claims

## Limitations

- **yfinance data**: Free but may have delays or gaps
- **No real-time data**: 15-minute delayed quotes
- **Historical data**: Limited to what yfinance provides
- **Not financial advice**: For educational/research purposes only

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Integration with Financial Modeling Prep for additional data sources
- [ ] SEC Edgar filing analysis
- [ ] Portfolio tracking and rebalancing suggestions
- [ ] Backtesting capabilities
- [ ] Custom watchlists
- [ ] Email/Slack alerts for opportunities
- [ ] DeMark Sequential indicator implementation
- [ ] Sentiment analysis from news and social media
