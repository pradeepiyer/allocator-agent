### Tools Available

The agent has access to these financial data tools:

- `get_stock_fundamentals()` - Financial metrics, ROIC, ROE, margins
- `get_insider_ownership()` - Insider holdings and transactions
- `get_institutional_holders()` - Major shareholders
- `get_share_data()` - Share count history and buybacks
- `get_management_compensation()` - Executive pay structure
- `get_technical_indicators()` - Price trends, RSI, MACD, moving averages
- `get_valuation_metrics()` - P/E, P/B, P/S, EV/EBITDA, PEG
- `get_financial_history()` - Multi-year trends
- `calculate_similarity()` - Stock comparison
- `find_similar_companies()` - Programmatic discovery of similar stocks by sector/industry

Plus built-in `web_search` for news, filings, and qualitative research.

## Configuration

### Agent Configuration

The agent config is in `agents/allocator/config.yaml` and will be auto-loaded by agent-kit.

```yaml
max_iterations: 25  # Allows for complex multi-step analysis
```

### Global agent-kit Configuration

Configure OpenAI model and settings in `~/.agent-kit/config.yaml`:

```yaml
openai:
  api_key: "${OPENAI_API_KEY}"
  model: "gpt-4o"
  pool_size: 8

agents:
  max_iterations: 20
  max_parallel_tools: 5
```

## Development

### Project Structure

The agent follows agent-kit's extension pattern:

1. **Tools** (`tools.py`): Python functions that fetch/analyze data
2. **Prompts** (`prompts/*.yaml`): YAML files encoding investment principles
3. **Agent** (`agent.py`): Methods that orchestrate tool calls using prompts
4. **Console** (`console.py`): User interface with slash commands

### Adding New Tools

1. Define the async function in `tools.py`
2. Add tool definition to `get_tool_definitions()`
3. Register in `execute_tool()` dispatcher
4. The LLM can now use it automatically

### Extending with More Data Sources

To add Financial Modeling Prep or other APIs:

1. Install additional package (e.g., `uv add financialmodelingprep`)
2. Add API functions to `tools.py`
3. Add corresponding tool definitions
4. Update prompts if needed

No changes to agent logic required - tools are automatically available to LLM.

## Examples

### Example: Comprehensive Allocator Report
```
/analyse BRK.B

Result: Complete allocator report with:

Part 1 - Stock Analysis:
- Buffett/Munger's capital allocation track record
- Insurance float as competitive advantage
- Ownership of wholly-owned subsidiaries
- Key Metrics (ROIC, ROE, margins, valuation multiples)
- Valuation vs book value
- Investment recommendation: Buy (High conviction)

Part 2 - Similar Companies:
1. MKL (Markel) - Similar insurance + investment model (Similarity: 78)
2. FFH (Fairfax Financial) - Comparable structure (Similarity: 72)
3. Y (Alleghany) - Insurance conglomerate (Similarity: 65)
Each with detailed similarity analysis
```

### Example: Workflow
```
/analyse AAPL

‚ñ∂ Generating comprehensive report for AAPL...

... analysis output displayed in console ...

‚ñ∂ Generating PDF report...
‚úì PDF report saved to reports/allocator-AAPL-20251016-143052.pdf

# Now you have both:
# 1. Console output for immediate reading
# 2. Professional PDF report for review/sharing
```

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Use `/analyse` for comprehensive reports**: Gets you analysis, similar companies, and PDF report automatically
2. **Review the PDF**: Contains unified comparison table and charts for deeper analysis
3. **Use chat for specific questions**: "What's AAPL's ROIC?" or "Compare GOOGL and META's capital allocation"
4. **Check comparison table in PDF**: Shows all metrics for reference stock and similar stocks side-by-side
5. **Explore similar companies**: Often reveals non-obvious investment alternatives
6. **Verify sources**: Agent cites all sources - always verify important claims

## Limitations

- **yfinance data**: Free but may have delays or gaps
- **No real-time data**: 15-minute delayed quotes
- **Historical data**: Limited to what yfinance provides
- **Not financial advice**: For educational/research purposes only

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Integration with Financial Modeling Prep for additional data sources
- [ ] SEC Edgar filing analysis
- [ ] Portfolio tracking and rebalancing suggestions
- [ ] Backtesting capabilities
- [ ] Custom watchlists
- [ ] Email/Slack alerts for opportunities
- [ ] DeMark Sequential indicator implementation
- [ ] Sentiment analysis from news and social media
